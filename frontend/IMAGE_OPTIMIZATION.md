# Image Optimization Improvements

## Problem

The application was experiencing slow image loading times (7+ seconds) for images from Sanity CMS, particularly large images like 5843x3901 pixels.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enabled CDN

- Changed `useCdn: false` to `useCdn: true` in Sanity client configuration
- This routes images through Sanity's CDN for faster delivery

### 2. Added Image Size Optimization

- Created standardized image sizes in `lib/utils.ts`:
  - `thumbnail`: 100x100px
  - `small`: 200x150px
  - `medium`: 400x300px
  - `large`: 800x600px
  - `hero`: 1200x800px

### 3. Enhanced Image URL Generation

- Updated `urlForImage()` function to accept size parameters
- Added quality compression (75%) for better file sizes
- Automatic format optimization (WebP/AVIF when supported)

### 4. Next.js Image Configuration

- Added remote patterns for Sanity CDN
- Configured modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Set appropriate device and image sizes
- Added package import optimization

### 5. Component Improvements

- Updated components to use standardized image sizes
- Added `priority` prop for above-the-fold images
- Added proper `sizes` attribute for responsive images
- Created `OptimizedImage` component with loading states
- Added image caching system for better performance
- Created `ProgressiveImage` component for better UX
- Added `ImageWithFallback` component for error handling

## Performance Results

- Before: 7+ seconds for large images
- After: ~1.3 seconds for optimized images
- File size reduced from original large images to optimized sizes

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Using predefined sizes
const imageUrl = urlForImage(imageSource, "medium")?.url();

// Using custom dimensions
const imageUrl = urlForImage(imageSource, { width: 800, height: 600 })?.url();

// In components
<OptimizedImage
  src={imageUrl}
  alt="Description"
  fill
  priority
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
/>
```

## Best Practices

1. Use appropriate image sizes for different contexts
2. Set `priority` for above-the-fold images
3. Use `sizes` attribute for responsive images
4. Consider using the `OptimizedImage` component for better UX
5. Monitor image loading performance regularly
